# Deals DB

## Overview
This two-part project is designed to provide practice with software tools and languages. Each assignment applies what you have learned in the classroom that week. __Do not do assignments until they are assigned. They are designed to complement the lectures and assigned reading.__

__You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers.__ However, you are also responsible for learning the key lessons of each assignment. So, if you need help, ask for it and pay attention to the answers. If you know how to help someone (without doing the work for them), then please help them out.

## Part 1: Systems Check
### Theory: You should know ...
* The purpose and use of each package in your software toolbox
* How the tools fit together into one seamless development environment

### Practice: You be able to ...
* Use the software we've adopted for this class
* Verify that the software is working correctly and debug if needed

### Instructions
__If any of the steps below fail, then ask for help. Often your best help will come from fellow students.__
1. __Use GitHub Classroom to create your own fork of this repository.__  
GitHub Classroom should send you an invitation email. If not then just click this invitation link. Follow instructions provided by GitHub to link your account to this classroom.
2. __Clone the repository to your workspace.__  
Click the `Clone or Download` link for your forked copy and then select use the URL to clone it to your Jupyter workspace. Instructions should have been provided to you in class.    
3. __Open the repository.__  
Double-clicking on it should suffice.    
4. __Open the `deals.sql` file.__  
Take a moment to read the file. You will find comments used to explain each section, including a header comment at the top of the file stating the purpose of the file.  
5. __Open the `Deals_Part1.ipynb` notebook.__  
Double-click the file to open it.  
6. __Take a moment to inspect the code cells.__  
The cells contain SQL queries to extract data from our database.

7. __Run the notebook to confirm that everything works.__  
You can run the cells one at a time or all at once. You should get two identical listings of companies, one using SQL Alchemy and another using %sql magic.

8. __Sign your name with empty cell at the bottom of the notebook.__  
If there is no empty cell, just add one yourself. You can add new cells with the '+' button at the top of the notebook. Make sure the type of the cell is Markdown.

9. __Commit and push your work to GitHub.__  
Follow directions in class to commit your work to git and push everything to GitHub.  

**Do not continue to Part 2 until you are told to do so.**

## Part 2: Select Queries
### Theory: You should know ...
* The common forms for SQL SELECT queries
* Each of the possible SQL SELECT clauses (in the correct order)
* How WHERE clauses and JOIN ... USING (...) expressions can be used to extract data from multiple tables
* How to call SQL functions in the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses
* How to aggregate results into groups of records (with group-wise stats, etc.)

### Practice: You be able to ...
* Write SQL select queries within Jupyter
* Debug queries based on i) errors reported by the interpreter and ii) your understanding of the source data

### Instructions
1. __Complete the Deal_Part2.ipynb notebook.__
Instructions are given in the notebook. You should do the work with your classmates. Don't forget to save your notebook when you are done.
2. __Review your answers.__
We will discuss everything together. If you get something wrong, then correct it!
3. __Commit and push to GitHub.__  
Use the Git comment 'Completed Part 2' and push to GitHub.
